### Goals
Twitch2DCS was primarily created so that DCS World streamers who played in VR could interact with Twitch chat without the need to take the HMD off, or have Twitch chat hooked up to a text-to-speech engine.   By allowing the chat to be visible within DCS the immersion of the game does not have to be broken, and VR streamers can still interact with the audience.  Twitch2DCS is not restricted to VR users, it will work for single monitor and surround setups.

### Features
* Separate in-game chat window (similar to multiplayer chat)
* Easily installed to Saved Games directory
* In-game twitch chat communicate both read and write
* Join/Part messages
* Customizable hotkey
* Not dependent on mission start.  The UI exists in every aspect of DCS (Main Menu, Config, Mission Editor, In-Mission) allowing you to always be connected to your twitch audience.
* Random colors assigned to each user in chat (simular to twitch)
* Colors are customizable in Config/Twitch2DCSConfig.lua
* Ability to use Multiplayer chat instead of Twitch chat.  *Using Multiplayer chat will only allow you to see twitch chat during multiplayer games*.
